## Vi-m

Why using Vim today ?
When we have :

 - [Cloud9](https://c9.io/)
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
 - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
 - [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 - [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
 - [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com)
 - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/specials/webstorm/webstorm.html)
 - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

### The good

 - lightweight, cross paltform
 - keyboard based
 - huge ecosystem
 - ergonomics (does the job really quickly)

### The bad

 - battery not included
 - learning curve
 - heterogeneous plugins
 - years of legacy and compat


## The Idea of distribution

 - Dotfiles to dotvim to webvim
 - Linux dist ported to the Vim world
 - Like eclipse, jetbrains dist

### Some hate the idea
 -

### Some loves it
 -

### It makes by z
## Difficulties

## Future
