# WebVim

I'm a JavaScript developer and my development environment is WebVim.

## What's your development environment ?

Atom, VS code, Cloud9.io, Eclipse, WebStorm ?

## I'm  developing with Vim.

Not exactly Vim, but 

## WebVim

It's a Vim based distribution that targets JavaScript, node.js and web development in general.

 Why ?

You'll ask me why do you use something like Vim nowadays ?

Because my fingers can edit text faster !

I remember seeing a sys admin colleague changing files faster than I could dream, really.

So I dig into Vim.

The Vim ecosystem is huge, there's a lot of plugins, a lot of features, but the barrier to entry is high, very very high.

I'ts the reason why I've created WebVim

A ready to go, Vim based distribution for developping in JavaScript and on the web stack.

I'm bundling together plugins, configuration, installation/update scripts, a documentation. 

So i've made the work you'll have to do when starting to use Vim.

Features ? 

 - ES2015+ supported
 - Syntax and error checking (jshint, eslint)
 - Autocomplete and refactoring (tern)
 - Module naviagtion
 - Multi cursors
 - Git 
 - Reformating
 - File convention (editorconfig)
 - All awesome stuffs Vim can do
